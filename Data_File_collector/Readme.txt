Simulation_file_collector_&_organize.py

Purpose:
- It is the python code for renaming the piston.txt files to a formate which has piston_{speed}_{pressure}_{displacement}.txt
- Second purpose is to collect the operating condition such as speed, pressure, displacement to csv.

Procedure:
- For this you should have a folder called "Datasets" in the same root directory of the python project.
- Inside this it is required to have the piston files inside the folder of specific Design parameter sets. such as, DSP1,DSP2, DSP3,....etc.
