That is, the user can use this input along with the other three inputs under the “Position” tab to specify how the piston’s central axis is tilted with respect to the central axis of the corresponding cylinder bore. xA is the distance along the x-axis from the piston’s central axis to the bore’s central axis, measured in Plane A. xA>0 if the point of intersection of the piston’s central axis with Plane A is to the right of (further in the positive x-direction than) the point of intersection of the bore’s central axis with Plane A.

	// The number of volumes in the fluid film circumference. There are two options: 1. The user sets nL to zero, and specifies the number of volumes in the fluid film circumference of the finest mesh. FSTI will then automatically calculate the number of volumes needed for the coarser meshes of the multigrid method. 2. nL is set to a number greater than zero, and the user enters the number of volumes in the fluid film circumference for each level, from finest to coarsest, separated by a comma. Minimum number of levels in this case: 2
